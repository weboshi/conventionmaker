                        At Convention Maker, our goal is to spread the enjoyment of convention going far and wide. 
                        Making websites can be a hassle, so we help you do it here, with no worries about hosting or hiring developers.
                        We hope to make it easier for convention operators to create lively and informative sites with only a few clicks.
                        When you create your convention site with us, it will also be added to our convention directory for others to find.
